## Structure

Inside the directory we can find the different functionalities developed for the correct functioning of the project. The structure of the project can be summarized as follows:

1. `Components` #Contains all the source code and style files for the custom components.
2. `Navigation` #This Navigation directory is responsible for handling the navigation logic of the application. It defines the routes, screens, and navigation stacks.
3. `Screens` #This directory consists of all the individual screens or views of the application. Each screen represents a specific user interface (UI) that the user can interact with. 
4. `Services` #Contains code responsible for connecting with Spotify APIs.
5. `Utils` #Contains helper functions that are used across different parts of the application.
6. `Assets` #The Assets directory is used to store static files, such as images, fonts, or other resources required by the project.
7. `Hooks` #This directory contain custom hooks that are used across the application.
8. `Context` #The Context directory holds the context providers and related code for managing the global state of the application, allowing data to be shared and accessed across different components and screens.

Before installation, make sure you are inside the source main directory.

## Installation

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone the repository
```js
git clone https://github.com/Marquez-David/SpotifyClone.git
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ app:

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
