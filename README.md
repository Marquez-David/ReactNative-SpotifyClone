## Description
This project is a clone of the popular music streaming application, Spotify. It has been developed using React Native, and the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) for music data. 
Please note that this project is still under development and may undergo changes in the future. To see the changes made so far, you can watch a short video [here](doc/img/SpotifyClone.gif), plus the rest of 
the [images](doc/img)

## Structure

This project is organized into two main directories: `doc` for documentation and `src` for source code. Before the installation, make sure that you are inside the source directory.

## Installation

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone the repository
```js
git clone https://github.com/Marquez-David/SpotifyClone.git
```

## Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 3: Start the Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio.
